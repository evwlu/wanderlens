## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Coming together and creating the necessary tables and diagrams for the milestone
was a relatively successful task. The wireframe and entity relationship diagrams
that we constructed turned out well in our opinions.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A few challenges that we faced were in finding software to help up create and
represent the diagrams as well as coming up with the ideas themselves. The two
diagrams did take a few revisions but we are still ultimately satisfied with 
our creation.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We are not yet aware of any specific issues that will require immediate support. 
However, as our project develops and we go through the motions of completing 
more features and implementation goals, we may require assistance and will
go about requesting it accordingly.
