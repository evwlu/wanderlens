## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Setting up the project board was a new experience for us and was a good step
for us to take in the learning process. With this we will be able to coordinate
better since previously our schedules did not necessarily align. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main challenge that our group faced for this week is that we were much busier
during the week than we originally anticipated. Though we set up a planning
mechanism, we haven't set up nearly as many features as we were hoping to have
done. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did not finish all of the tasks that our sprint plan had set up for this week.
Since we did not, we will prioritize setting up the server/backend and frontend
skeletons to allow for us to work on different features concurrently. Afterwards,
we will be able to better delegate and prioritize our remaining features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

None of our features or user stories are currently at risk. One that we may be
concerned about in the future could be the map design. If we cannot complete the
map design, we will instead implement a list-based structure that allows for 
comprehensive access via search engine.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We are not yet aware of any specific issues that will require immediate support. 
However, as our project develops and we go through the motions of completing 
more features and implementation goals, we may require assistance and will
go about requesting it accordingly.
