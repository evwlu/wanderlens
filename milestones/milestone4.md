## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We got the server and client sides working. This is the basis of our project and
we formatting the repository according to how we saw our project playing out. 
Overall, this week was mostly geared towards setup and we accomplished this.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We're not very experienced with CSS, so it was hard for us to style the pages. 
We faced many minor technical, but overall demotivating bugs that were relatively
annoying throughout our development process.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We didn't finish all our tasks in our sprint plan for this week but because both
of us got a lot of exams (and one of us was sick for a big portion of the week).
However, we plan to work on the features that we are missing accordingly as the
week progresses next week and finish up the project's features in a triaged
fashion.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A potential "at risk" user story could be the map plan. While it isn't necessarily
the case that we had trouble with the implementation itself, it is our biggest 
perceived time sink that we haven't been able to get to due to technical issues
with the other components.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We are not yet aware of any specific issues that will require immediate support. 
However, as our project develops and we go through the motions of completing 
more features and implementation goals, we may require assistance and will
go about requesting it accordingly.
