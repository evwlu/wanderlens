## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We came together and found an app that we would both be passionate to work on!
Ultimately, our communication was good and we figured out how to get through 
the work at the end of the day, which was great for the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A few of the troubles that our group faced during this unit were timing and some
coordination issues. Since we were both swapped from our original partners, 
coming together to find a time to meet was subject to time constraints and we 
were both relatively busy. Ultimately, though, we managed to come together and
set something up :).

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We are not yet aware of any specific issues that will require immediate support. 
However, as our project develops and we go through the motions of completing 
more features and implementation goals, we may require assistance and will
go about requesting it accordingly.
